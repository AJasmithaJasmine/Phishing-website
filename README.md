# Phishing-website
The objective is to train machine learning models and deep neural networks to detect phishing websites. The project involves creating a dataset from both phishing and benign URLs, extracting relevant URL and website content-based features, and then measuring and comparing the performance of different models. By systematically preparing a comprehensive dataset, extracting relevant features, and evaluating various models, the project provides valuable insights into the performance and suitability of different algorithms for this cybersecurity challenge. The work lays a strong foundation for developing robust and intelligent systems to combat the ever-evolving threat of phishing attacks, ultimately contributing to a safer online environment.
